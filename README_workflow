Workflow:
  1. Run "base_df.R" to get base dataframes and site by species into global environment
    a. This reduces the load on each indvidual file
    b. Organizes source data 
  2. Run various analysis 
    a. each analysis file contains all necessary base data files to run (ie phylogeny          has fasta files)
    b. However, the required site by species matrices or environmental matrices are          not included and need to be run prior with "base_df.R"
