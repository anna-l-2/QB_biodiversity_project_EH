Data set: Continous Forrest Inventory 
Question: What is the influence of the type of mycrorhizal association on tree species abundance when exposed to the pressure of invasive species? 
Hypothesis: 
Week 1:
Determine dataset: Continous Forrest Inventory

Week 2 
Load that dataset.
How many sites are there?
How many species are there in the entire site-by-species matrix?
Any other interesting observations based on what you learned this week?

Week 3 
Determined question
Elaine- find mycrozhyral association 
Anna- look at invasive species data- see if plots have invansives
Will have two site by species matrix 1 for AM 1 for ECM 
Then further segregate if plot has invansives v does not - will apply to species to filter out different the AM or ECM
  Follow up question: Does number of invasives influence tree species abundance
End goal: 4 different Site by species matrix: AM+Invasives; AM-No invasives; ECM+Invasives; ECM-No invasives - code stored in base_df.R
